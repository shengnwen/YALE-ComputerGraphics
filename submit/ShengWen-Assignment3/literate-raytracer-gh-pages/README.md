# literate-raytracer

This is a literate [raytracer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics),
written in Javascript. The [demo, code listing, and explanation](http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/)
are all one part: you can understand the implementation by reading it in combination
with literate-style code comments.

This is intended as a learning platform for those trying to connect the mathematical
and engineering explanations of raytracing and understand the behavior of the algorithm
well enough to do interesting things.

## Helping

Submit a normal pull request with more docs or clarified code! To rebuild the literate pages:

    npm install
    npm run-script doc
