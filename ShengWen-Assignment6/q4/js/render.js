// # Throwing Rays
//
// This is one part where we can't follow nature exactly: technically photons
// come out of lights, bounce off of objects, and then some hit the 'eye'
// and many don't. Simulating this - sending rays in all directions out of
// each light and most not having any real effect - would be too inefficient.
//
// Luckily, the reverse is more efficient and has practically the same result -
// instead of rays going 'from' lights to the eye, we follow rays from the eye
// and see if they end up hitting any features and lights on their travels.
//
// For each pixel in the canvas, there needs to be at least one ray of light
// that determines its color by bouncing through the scene.
function render(scene) {
    // first 'unpack' the scene to make it easier to reference

    var camera = scene.camera,
        objects = scene.objects,
        lights = scene.lights;
    var img = [ ];
    var img2 = [ ];

   

    // This process
    // is a bit odd, because there's a disconnect between pixels and vectors:
    // given the left and right, top and bottom rays, the rays we shoot are just
    // interpolated between them in little increments.
    //
    // Starting with the height and width of the scene, the camera's place,
    // direction, and field of view, we calculate factors that create
    // `width*height` vectors for each ray

    // Start by creating a simple vector pointing in the direction the camera is
    // pointing - a unit vector
// updated for Assn 6 so that camera.vector is more descriptively camera.toPoint
// updated for Assn 6 so that there is a camera.up instead of using vector.UP


    var eyeVector = Vector.unitVector(Vector.subtract(camera.toPoint, camera.point)),
        // and then we'll rotate this by combining it with a version that's turned
        // 90° right and one that's turned 90° up. Since the [cross product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product)
        // takes two vectors and creates a third that's perpendicular to both,
        // we use a pure 'UP' vector to turn the camera right, and that 'right'
        // vector to turn the camera up.

        // The actual ending pixel dimensions of the image aren't important here -
        // note that `width` and `height` are in pixels, but the numbers we compute

        // `fieldOfView` of the camera.
